# Blockchain-Based-Decentralized-Food-Delivery-System
It's an idea to decentralized the food delivery system. Here I uploaded only contracts for the food delivery system. Contracts are Customer, Restaurant and DeliveryBoy. If separtaly this three contracts won't work then to run this you have to combine of all of these thress contracts. 
I use Remix- Ethereum IDE.
